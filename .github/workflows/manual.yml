General Info
testnet
Most of the endpoints can be also used in the testnet platform.
The REST baseurl for testnet is "https://testnet.binancefuture.com"
The Websocket baseurl for testnet is "wss://dstream.binancefuture.com"
General API Information
The base endpoint is: https://dapi.binance.com
All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
Data is returned in ascending order. Oldest first, newest last.
All time and timestamp related fields are in milliseconds.
All data types adopt definition in JAVA.
HTTP Return Codes
HTTP 4XX return codes are used for for malformed requests; the issue is on the sender's side.
HTTP 403 return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall) has been violated.
HTTP 408 return code is used when a timeout has occurred while waiting for a response from the backend server.
HTTP 429 return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
HTTP 418 return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving 429 codes.
HTTP 5XX return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on Binance's side.
If there is an error message "Request occur unknown error.", please retry later.
HTTP 503 return code is used when:
If there is an error message "Unknown error, please check your request or try again later." returned in the response, the API successfully sent the request but not get a response within the timeout period.
It is important to NOT treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is UNKNOWN and could have been a success;
If there is an error message "Service Unavailable." returned in the response, it means this is a failure API operation and the service might be unavailable at the moment, you need to retry later.
If there is an error message "Internal error; unable to process your request. Please try again." returned in the response, it means this is a failure API operation and you can resend your request if you need.
Error Codes and Messages
Any endpoint can return an ERROR
The error payload is as follows:

{
  "code": -1121,
  "msg": "Invalid symbol."
}

Specific error codes and messages defined in Error Codes.
General Information on Endpoints
For GET endpoints, parameters must be sent as a query string.
For POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a query string or in the request body with content type application/x-www-form-urlencoded. You may mix parameters between both the query string and request body if you wish to do so.
Parameters may be sent in any order.
If a parameter sent in both the query string and request body, the query string parameter will be used.
LIMITS
The /dapi/v1/exchangeInfo rateLimits array contains objects related to the exchange's RAW_REQUEST, REQUEST_WEIGHT, and ORDER rate limits. These are further defined in the ENUM definitions section under Rate limiters (rateLimitType).
A 429 will be returned when either rate limit is violated.
Binance has the right to further tighten the rate limits on users with intent to attack.
IP Limits
Every request will contain X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter) in the response headers which has the current used weight for the IP for all request rate limiters defined.
Each route has a weight which determines for the number of requests each endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on multiple symbols will have a heavier weight.
When a 429 is received, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not spam the API.
Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban (HTTP status 418).
IP bans are tracked and scale in duration for repeat offenders, from 2 minutes to 3 days.
The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.
It is strongly recommended to use websocket stream for getting data as much as possible, which can not only ensure the timeliness of the message, but also reduce the access restriction pressure caused by the request.
Order Rate Limits
Every order response will contain a X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter) header which has the current order count for the account for all order rate limiters defined.
Rejected/unsuccessful orders are not guaranteed to have X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-** headers in the response.
The order rate limit is counted against each account.
Endpoint Security Type
Each endpoint has a security type that determines the how you will interact with it.
API-keys are passed into the Rest API via the X-MBX-APIKEY header.
API-keys and secret-keys are case sensitive.
API-keys can be configured to only access certain types of secure endpoints. For example, one API-key could be used for TRADE only, while another API-key can access everything except for TRADE routes.
By default, API-keys can access all secure routes.
Security Type	Description
NONE	Endpoint can be accessed freely.
TRADE	Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.
USER_DATA	Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.
USER_STREAM	Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.
MARKET_DATA	Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.
TRADE and USER_DATA endpoints are SIGNED endpoints.
SIGNED (TRADE and USER_DATA) Endpoint Security
SIGNED endpoints require an additional parameter, signature, to be sent in the query string or request body.
Endpoints use HMAC SHA256 signatures. The HMAC SHA256 signature is a keyed HMAC SHA256 operation. Use your secretKey as the key and totalParams as the value for the HMAC operation.
The signature is not case sensitive.
Please make sure the signature is the end part of your query string or request body.
totalParams is defined as the query string concatenated with the request body.
Timing security
A SIGNED endpoint also requires a parameter, timestamp, to be sent which should be the millisecond timestamp of when the request was created and sent.
An additional parameter, recvWindow, may be sent to specify the number of milliseconds after timestamp the request is valid for. If recvWindow is not sent, it defaults to 5000.
If the server determines that the timestamp sent by the client is more than one second in the future of the server time, the request will also be rejected.
The logic is as follows:

  if (timestamp < (serverTime + 1000) && (serverTime - timestamp) <= recvWindow){
    // process request
  } 
  else {
    // reject request
  }

Serious trading is about timing. Networks can be unstable and unreliable, which can lead to requests taking varying amounts of time to reach the servers. With recvWindow, you can specify that the request must be processed within a certain number of milliseconds or be rejected by the server.

It is recommended to use a small recvWindow of 5000 or less!

SIGNED Endpoint Examples for POST /dapi/v1/order - RSA Keys
This will be a step by step process how to create the signature payload to send a valid signed payload.
We support PKCS#8 currently.
To get your API key, you need to upload your RSA Public Key to your account and a corresponding API key will be provided for you.
For this example, the private key will be referenced as test-prv-key.pem

Key	Value
apiKey	vE3BDAL1gP1UaexugRLtteaAHg3UO8Nza20uexEuW1Kh3tVwQfFHdAiyjjY428o2
Parameter	Value
symbol	BTCUSD_PERP
side	SELL
type	MARKET
quantity	100
recvWindow	9999999
timestamp	1671090801999
Signature payload (with the listed parameters):

timestamp=1671090801999&recvWindow=9999999&symbol=BTCUSD_PERP&side=SELL&type=MARKET&quantity=100

Step 1: Construct the payload

Arrange the list of parameters into a string. Separate each parameter with a &.

Step 2: Compute the signature:

2.1 - Encode signature payload as ASCII data.

Step 2.2

 $ echo -n 'timestamp=1671090801999&recvWindow=9999999&symbol=BTCUSD_PERP&side=SELL&type=MARKET&quantity=100' | openssl dgst -keyform PEM -sha256 -sign ./test-prv-key.pem


2.2 - Sign payload using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithm with SHA-256 hash function.

Step 2.3

$ echo -n 'timestamp=1671090801999&recvWindow=9999999&symbol=BTCUSD_PERP&side=SELL&type=MARKET&quantity=100' | openssl dgst -keyform PEM -sha256 -sign ./test-prv-key.pem | openssl enc -base64

2.3 - Encode output as base64 string.

Step 2.4

$  echo -n 'timestamp=1671090801999&recvWindow=9999999&symbol=BTCUSD_PERP&side=SELL&type=MARKET&quantity=100' | openssl dgst -keyform PEM -sha256 -sign ./test-prv-key.pem | openssl enc -base64 | tr -d '\n'

2.4 - Delete any newlines in the signature.

Step 2.5

aap36wD5loVXizxvvPI3wz9Cjqwmb3KVbxoym0XeWG1jZq8umqrnSk8H8dkLQeySjgVY91Ufs%2BBGCW%2B4sZjQEpgAfjM76riNxjlD3coGGEsPsT2lG39R%2F1q72zpDs8pYcQ4A692NgHO1zXcgScTGgdkjp%2Brp2bcddKjyz5XBrBM%3D


2.5 - Since the signature may contain / and =, this could cause issues with sending the request. So the signature has to be URL encoded.

Step 2.6

 curl -H "X-MBX-APIKEY: vE3BDAL1gP1UaexugRLtteaAHg3UO8Nza20uexEuW1Kh3tVwQfFHdAiyjjY428o2" -X POST 'https://dapi.binance.com/dapi/v1/order?timestamp=1671090801999&recvWindow=9999999&symbol=BTCUSD_PERP&side=SELL&type=MARKET&quantity=100&signature=aap36wD5loVXizxvvPI3wz9Cjqwmb3KVbxoym0XeWG1jZq8umqrnSk8H8dkLQeySjgVY91Ufs%2BBGCW%2B4sZjQEpgAfjM76riNxjlD3coGGEsPsT2lG39R%2F1q72zpDs8pYcQ4A692NgHO1zXcgScTGgdkjp%2Brp2bcddKjyz5XBrBM%3D'


2.6 - curl command
